            "When we want to help the poor, we usually offer them charity. Most
            often we use charity to avoid recognizing the problem and finding
            the solution for it. Charity becomes a way to shrug off our
            responsibility. But charity is no solution to poverty. Charity only
            perpetuates poverty by taking the initiative away from the poor.
            Charity allows us to go ahead with our own lives without worrying
            about the lives of the poor. Charity appeases our consciences"
